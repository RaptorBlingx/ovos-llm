## 1 TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE

### 1.1 Objectives of the experiment

```
Energy Management System (EnMS) solutions are essential for industrial plants to manage energy
planning and efficiency amid volatile energy supply and prices. These systems also contribute to resource
efficiency, reducing water and raw material use, waste, and carbon emissions, aligning with cleaner
production methodologies.
```
```
However, managing EnMS across a factory is challenging, as it involves almost all factory processes,
including production, maintenance, HR, procurement, planning, Q&A, and R&D. This complexity demands
significant human expertise, communication, coordination, and effort.
```
```
Another challenge is interpreting the vast data from various sources (e.g., raw materials, production,
storage, weather) alongside energy data.
```
```
To address challenges, we aim to develop a Human-centric EnMS that fosters digital transformation and
increases the efficiency of resource usage by prioritizing workers' engagement and well-being. By digital
intelligent assistant elements, we aim to enhance human engagement with the system, facilitate
operations and guide users to monitor the efficiency and take action accordingly.
```
```
System to be developed with the prior experience and the technical base of Intelligent energy
Management System (Intel50001) Software of A Plus Engineering will be collecting; manufacturing data
(ie. Raw material, production volume, water consumption, working hours, waste amount etc), climate
related data (ie. HDD, CDD, humidity, precipitation etc), operational data (ie. maintenance, training etc.)
that effects energy consumption in the facility.
```
```
Machine learning functions for data classification, correlation, trends, time-series and regression will be
used to determine significant energy users, energy drivers, key performance indicators and energy
baseline of the facility, which will lead system to monitor, analyse and report expected energy
consumption and compare it with the real one and guide factory users for saving and efficiency measures
with the AI assisted decision support system.
```
```
The objective of this experiment is development of voice and text based digital intelligent assistant to be
integrated to an energy management system software to increase human interaction and well-being
while increasing energy performance of industrial facilities.
```
```
It is planned to share digital assistant along with improvements with the main base features of energy
management as open-source to manufacturing SMEs to increase awareness on energy management
systems, to enhance WASABI use case portfolio and disseminate the usage of digital intelligent assistant
as an important human-centric digitalization feature at the industrial SMEs.
```
```
With the implementation of the experiment it will be possible to increase sustainability of industrial SMEs
by facilitating the energy system management usage and increasing human engagement which will lead
the resource efficiency which obviously leads carbon emissions reduction while promoting human-
centric green digitalization, artificial intelligence usage for decision making in industry, open-source
```

```
usage and digital intelligent assistant usage which we believe and understand that are aligned with the
WASABI open call objectives.
```
### 1.2 Experiment overview

```
Our product Intel50001 primarily focus on energy management for industrial applications, particularly in
manufacturing industry sectors. Although energy intensive industrial manufacturing sectors has critical
and prioritized need of an intelligent decision support system for energy management, it is considered as
sector independent regarding the sub-sectors of manufacturing industry as energy management and
resource efficiency has importance for all of them. The system will be integrated to WASABI’s digital
assistance framework and will be offering real time energy performance insights with the power of
conversational AI interfaces. The system is going to offer workers to interact with complex energy data in
a more easily and efficiently way and also an intelligent text-based assistant to ease learning from digital
library of the management system.
```
```
The experiment will have a transnational context to increase cross-border collaboration and
dissemination throughout Europe. R&D development activities will be held in Turkey as A Plus
Engineering team is already located in a Technology Development Zone in Mersin, Turkey. Experiment
implementation, ie. Field trials will be implemented in a manufacturing industry plant at Romania where
the Digital Innovation Hub which Collaborative Innovation will be conducted is located, ie. Green eDIH.
```
```
We plan to increase user engagement and system performance by:
```
```
i) Implementing open-source voice AI platform (OVOS) integration to Intel50001 to enable users
interact with the software with voice commands to support easier usage of the management
system with less experienced system level users like facility manager, energy manager,
production chief, operator etc.
```
```
ii) integrating text-based digital assistant to knowledge base library of Intel50001 software to
support learning processes of system and operation level users on energy management system
standards, energy and resource efficiency, and their company’s energy management policy and
procedures.
```
```
iii) Enhancing digital assistant features to warn and give advice to users to increase resource
efficiency and appreciate the users for the actions that affects energy or resource efficiency
performance with the aim of increasing humans' wellbeing while increasing awareness and
engagement
Experiments one of the important activities will be field trials at a appropriate factory in Romania which will
be determined and selected by Green eDIH within the context of planned and agreed Collaborative
Innovation Services.
```
### 1.3 Scientific and Technological Excellence

```
Energy Management System Software ecosystem is not using digital intelligent assistant (DIA). So, state-
of-the art is artificial intelligence assisted decision making for energy management without DIA.
```

```
Intel50001’s development with human-centric features and DIA, with WASABI technology will be
disruptive for the market and the end user manufacturing SMEs. Today’s rapidly increasing use of AI brings
with it many innovation opportunities. Energy systems are inherently complex and have a multi-module
structure. There are many integrations that need to be implemented, monitored, analysed and predicted
for better decision making. Combining AI-powered analytics with real-time conversational interfaces will
make it easier to monitor these complex processes and enable direct interaction with data, thus setting a
new standard for energy monitoring and optimization implementation practices in accordance with
ISO50001.
```
```
During the project, we’ll be developing and providing scalable restful web application. Our web services
are already working in isolated docker containers, and this methodology helps when a requirement of
new service. All isolated containers will be communicating with each other via network created in docker-
compose technology. This project will also utilize open-source framework OVOS as a digital assistance.
We are aiming to create custom skills for OVOS required actions and these skills will be using RESTful API
endpoints. At the first steps we are planning to use interface as COALA App, however, at the following
phases of interface, we are planning to integrate OVOS docker-compose containers to our application and
create a fully functional digital assistant.
```
```
A Plus Engineering already has a commercialized, TRL 9, Energy Management System Software, in use at
different sectors including electronic equipment production, household appliances production, mining
and textile industries at different companies in Turkey and Romania. However, adding human-centric
features including digital intelligent assistant will be a totally R&D experiment for us. Company has the
software engineers with prior experience of Artificial Intelligence usage and already made some
implementation practices also in our Energy Management System for decision making supportive
operations. On the other hand, our awareness and studies with DIA and particularly OVOS are quite new
and has been triggered with WASABI call and our team started to work on the feasibility studies to ensure
if our technology complies with the WASABI technology. As we successfully managed the validation in our
server’s environment with our working EnMS system, we consider our technology readiness as between
TRL 4 and TRL 5 for implementation of DIA technologies.
```
```
We aim to develop the solution up to TRL7 - TRL8 within the experiment and developing our solution to a
new technological level which is expected to be novel and disruptive for the market.
```
### 1.4 Collaboration with the WASABI team

```
Receiving workshop trainings, documentation of the WASABI stack, getting access to the Docker Compose
project are already foreseen and determined tangible expectations from the WASABI team. Moreover,
main collaboration expectation with WASABI team will be mentoring, advice and feedback. We are already
aware of the insufficient technical expertise of our team regarding Digital Smart Assistant technologies
which is planned to be assisted and developed with the support of Green eDIH within the Collaboration
Innovation Service package they are going to provide us during the experiment. However, expertise of
WASABI team will be crucial in case of issues with the WASABI stack. Besides, feedback and guidance
during integrating WASABI technology to the Intel50001 system, especially in optimizing the
conversational AI interfaces and deploying the system using the Docker Compose project for OVOS will be
appreciated to ensure developing a successful use case. We will also be looking for mentoring and
guidance to ensure the compatibility of the system with the existing WASABI architecture and ensuring
compatibility with the necessary technology platforms.
```

## 2 IMPACT

### 2.1 Expected impact on the SME

```
Energy Management System software needs various type and amount of data regarding manufacturing,
operational and climate related data to produce accurate results to ensure efficient energy management
within a manufacturing SME. Although it is possible to upload the data as excel files to the system, it still
needs that data to be measured which is the minimum base of digitalization for a manufacturing SME to
be able to establish an Energy Management System.
```
```
Critical need of increased sustainability and resource efficiency for manufacturing SME motivates them to
increase digitalization when they understand it is really important for their competitiveness both to
minimize the costs and to comply the regulations comes with European Green Deal.
```
```
The integration of Intel50001 system with WASABI DIA will significantly increase the digitalization process
in energy management as it will be easier to establish and manage with less technical expertise of the
users, which will foster manufacturing SMEs to invest in digitalization. Having the solution as open-source
and in comply with the other WASABI technology solutions and use cases will also an important trigger to
increase the impact. With the power of conversational AI, our system will allow workers to interact with
complex energy data and reduce the required skills to access system and interpret system and energy
performance in a more efficiently way.
```
```
The expected technological, economic, and commercial impacts include:
```
- Technological: With increased automation of energy monitoring and management, will allow
    more efficient energy use and real-time decision making capabilities with DIA contributions.
- Economical: Energy cost reduction through AI-powered optimization and predictive analysis
    which will directly impact operational efficiency and savings of costs and warning-advice
    mechanism of DIA
- Commercial Impact: In this new, Voice Assistant implemented Intel50001 can be marketed as
    cutting-edge, AI-driven energy management solution which giving to the company a competitive
    advantage in energy management and sustainability market.

Technical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

- 3 0% reduction in overall energy management efforts of operational users including
    understanding the standards, requirement, documentation, policy and procedures
- Reduction in technical intervention of system users to monitor, analyse and report energy
    efficiency for better energy management tasks by 25%
- Successful integration of Intel50001 into the WASABI technology platform with DIA
    implementation of at least 3 different modules including monitoring, analyses and
    documentation.

```
Since the technologies and interfaces to be used and developed during the experiment will be in isolation
in the Docker environment, they can be directly applied to many embedded systems, adapted to
```

```
different SMEs, and easily scaled and easily used. Since the voice assistant is configured in a capability-
based manner, scaling is not expected to involve any software challenges.
```
```
As one of the final outputs of the experiment, it is planned to share an open-source energy management
system base with core functionalities to be used along with DIA by the manufacturing SMEs, we believe it
will create a significant understanding and wide-spread usage of DIA supported Energy Management
usage by manufacturing SMEs also with the exploitation power and support of WASABI consortium and
its portfolio. Thus, green and artificial intelligent assisted energy management decision making system
will be contributing to the sustainability, particularly resource efficiency and carbon emission reduction
of manufacturing SMEs.
```
### 2.2 Dissemination and exploitation plan

```
To ensure the wide dissemination of the results, we will implement a comprehensive communication
strategy. This includes:
```
- Publishing a case study and a white paper about integration of DIA into energy management systems
    with emphasizing the collaboration with WASABI.
- Organizing at least 4 workshops and webinars targeting manufacturers to demonstrate the real-world
    scenarios of the Intel50001 system enhanced by DIA technology.
- Participating 2 international congress and exhibitions one in Turkey in October 2025 ( EIF 2025 – World
    Energy Congress & Exhibition ) and 1 in a European Union member country (the exact event to be
    determined later) to present the solution and to showcase the outcomes and benefits of the project
- Exhibiting and presenting solution at a showcase to Romanian manufacturing SMEs which will be
    organized by Green eDIH, within the Collaborative Innovation Package
- Effective usage of social media and digital marketing to increase the outreach.
- Attend to networking events to be organized by WASABI consortium.

```
Commercialization: Human-Centric Intelligent Energy Management System with Digital Intelligent
Assistant will be offered to manufacturing SMEs as open-source solution with DIA integrated energy
management system base. However, as a more comprehensive solution DIA integrated Intel50001 will be
provided as a premium, AI-driven energy management solution compliant with ISO50001 standards. The
new AI features and conversational interfaces will differentiate the product in the market.
```
```
Intellectual Property (IPR): Open-source solution is considered to be provided with GPL license with
expectation of mentioning the copyright to our company and not to be used for further commercialized
to be distributed for profit without our permission. However, as we are not well informed about WASABI’s
open-source policy, we are planning to consult WASABI team and get their advice and guidance to
proceed with the compliance to WASABI open-source policy and finalize our IPR plan at the 2nd month of
the experiment implementation according to the timeline of the experiment. On the other hand, IPR of
the commercial version, ie. Intel50001 software will stay to be owned by our company.
```

Operational Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to be reached by dissemination activities and will increase
awareness and exploitation of the experiment and WASABI Technologies :

- Reaching out more than 100 different manufacturing SMEs by attending congress, exhibitions,
    project showcases and networking events
- Having interactions with at least 1000 person from manufacturing SME ecosystem by
    implementing dissemination and exploitation plan
